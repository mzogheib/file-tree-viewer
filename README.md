# File Tree Viewer
## Assumptions
* No text formatting required on file/folder labels, e.g. capitalisation 
* Ordering of files/folders not required
* File nodes will never have a children array
* No need to remember the open state of subfolders after closing a parent folder
* File extensions can be displayed
